1. Why do we start learning a programming language with â€œHello, World!"?

:- "Hello, World!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in 
a given language, and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer 
software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and 
that its operator understands how to use it.

2. How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?

:- HTML <!--...--> Tag
The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. 
Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your 
code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is 
especially useful if you have a lot of code.

3. What are elements,tags and attributes and the difference between them.

:- It is important to note that both the tags and attributes are within an element. 
While the elements tell the browser what to display, the attributes define how 
they will behave. The tags mark the beginning and the end of an element. 
They may not be necessary for some elements, especially the closing tags.

4. Briefly explain what HTML entities are.

:- An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand 
( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Entities are frequently used to display 
reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), 
and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).
