1. What is Emment?

:- Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed 
coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats 
via content assist. The project was started by Vadim Makeev in 2008 
and continues to be actively developed by Sergey Chikuyonok and Emmet users.

2. What are the advantages of using Emmet.

:- Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to 
type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. 
By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. 
Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing 
tags, leading to more robust and valid files.
